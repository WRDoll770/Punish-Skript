The skript is Free-To-Use. Please do not change the author or any other part of the code exept from the options!
If any other part of the code is changed, you are no longer allowed to use it and the use of this code becomes illegal!
You need SkBee and SKQuery as same as Essentials.
I reserve the right to revoke the right to use the script individually and if a ban is ignored on my part, legal consequences will follow.
Please Read the Terms of Service and accept them in the Skript. (https://wrdoll.wordpress.com/skripts/terms-of-service/)
